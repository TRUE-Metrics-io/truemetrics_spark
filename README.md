## Getting Started

## Pre-Commit
To enforce code quality, this repo uses pre-commit hooks. In particular, [`ruff`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) is used as a code formatter/linter by way of [the `ruff` pre-commit hook](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit).
To use this, please take the following steps to set up `pre-commit` locally:
1. `pip install pre-commit` to install `pre-commit` to your environment.
2. `pre-commit install` to set up the `pre-commit` hooks.
